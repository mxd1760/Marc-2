-Story Mode: 
X number of songs in a set order, but branching paths. 
Songs get progressively more difficult as you progress.
Some tutorial stages meant to ease players into different mechanics.
"Worlds" of some sort, with each world having a different musical
genre as the theme, such as rock, jazz, or pop. 
Enemies and boss fights throughout the story with the player needing
to figure out the key to defeating the boss. Enemies are weaker and
serve mainly as small obstacles within the stage. 
Story possibly deals with a person who is unappreciative of music, 
but learning throughout the story how to appreciate it more.
